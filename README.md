# **Script for rename files**

## Introduction
This script arises from a personal need in my day-to-day life as a front-end developer.
In it, you can rename several files in the same folder that contain the same word, rename a single file that contains a specific word and rename a file completely.

## How to run
node + javascript file name

### Warning
You need to have Node.js installed on your machine to be able to run this script.
